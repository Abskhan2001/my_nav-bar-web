                <h1>The Money Heist Professor</h1>
                <p>The Professor, real name Sergio, mostly grew up in hospitals due to being a sick child. He leads the
                    gang, and is the one who carefully plans and organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the Bank of
                    Spain. He is sophisticated but nerdy. The idea of the first heist is to avenge his father, whose
                    idea it originally was. His grandfather had fought against the fascists in Italy. He was the
                    mastermind behind the plans of the two heists. He controlled the heist through a hiding outside the
                    Royal Mint.[2] The Professor falls in love with Raquel Murillo, a police investigator leading the
                    case against the heist. He sleeps with her and when her mother finds out about his involvement with
                    the heist, he attempts to poison her but pulls out at the last second, opting to take advantage of
                    her poor memory and deleting the voicemail. The Professor spent years of his life meticulously
                    planning the heist, and covered aspects that most people wouldnâ€™t think of. His tactic was to lead
                    the police to several dead ends to buy more time for the money to be printed and the team to escape.
